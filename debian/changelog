telepathy-mission-control-5 (5.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Building the libraries statically now works, so do that, since we don't
      want to use them outside this source package
    - Install the new man pages for all executables
    - Remove GConf build dependency (which is now optional) since we're not
      going to install mc-account-convert anyway

telepathy-mission-control-5 (5.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload of Mission Control 5 (Closes: #534750), which will
    eventually replace telepathy-mission-control. It's basically a rewrite of
    MC 4, and is incompatible but parallel-installable, so I've packaged it
    from scratch.
  * Don't package libmcclient headers, development symlink or docs, but just
    bundle the shared library (which has -release versioning) with the daemon:
    it's not ABI-stable, and shouldn't be used in mainstream distributions
    (use telepathy-glib instead). The shared library has to remain shared,
    since it has symbols that collide with the daemon itself (albeit with the
    same implementations; this is in the process of being fixed upstream).
  * Don't package mc-account-convert, since it's the only thing in this
    package that needs gconf, and Empathy will probably ship its own
    MC 4 to MC 5 converter (perhaps based on mc-account-convert).
