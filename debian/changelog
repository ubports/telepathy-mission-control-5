telepathy-mission-control-5 (1:5.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream stable release
  * Roll back to version 5.4.x for unstable, with an epoch.
    - doesn't corrupt accounts whose parameters contain tab, newline
      or backslash (Closes: #586099, LP: #590619)
    - urgency=high for the RC bug fix
    - if your ~/.mission-control/accounts.cfg is huge (multiple megabytes)
      after using 5.5.0, see
      https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28557 for a workaround

telepathy-mission-control-5 (5.5.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge from experimental into unstable. We've decided to keep 5.5.x in
    unstable at least for the moment; if it turns out to be problematic, we
    can re-upload with an epoch.

telepathy-mission-control-5 (5.5.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * No changes.
    (This was a failed attempt to recover from 5.5.0-1 incorrectly being
    uploaded to unstable, by uploading with the correct distribution
    before 5.5.0-1 was accepted from the NEW queue. The ftp-masters were
    too fast...)

      upstream git)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jul 2009 12:11:55 +0100

telepathy-mission-control-5 (5.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Building the libraries statically now works, so do that, since we don't
      want to use them outside this source package
    - Install the new man pages for all executables
    - Remove GConf build dependency (which is now optional) since we're not
      going to install mc-account-convert anyway

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 09 Jul 2009 10:36:56 +0100

telepathy-mission-control-5 (5.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload of Mission Control 5 (Closes: #534750), which will
    eventually replace telepathy-mission-control. It's basically a rewrite of
    MC 4, and is incompatible but parallel-installable, so I've packaged it
    from scratch.
  * Don't package libmcclient headers, development symlink or docs, but just
    bundle the shared library (which has -release versioning) with the daemon:
    it's not ABI-stable, and shouldn't be used in mainstream distributions
    (use telepathy-glib instead). The shared library has to remain shared,
    since it has symbols that collide with the daemon itself (albeit with the
    same implementations; this is in the process of being fixed upstream).
  * Don't package mc-account-convert, since it's the only thing in this
    package that needs gconf, and Empathy will probably ship its own
    MC 4 to MC 5 converter (perhaps based on mc-account-convert).
