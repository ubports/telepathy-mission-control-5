telepathy-mission-control-5 (1:5.12.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of Mission Control will automatically migrate Windows
  Live Messenger accounts (also known as .NET Messenger, MSN Messenger etc.)
  from telepathy-butterfly to telepathy-haze when it starts up. To trigger
  this migration, ensure that telepathy-haze is installed, log out
  from your desktop session, and log back in.

  This has been done to support newer Telepathy interfaces required
  by Empathy 3.4, which are not present in telepathy-butterfly.
