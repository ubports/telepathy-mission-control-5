    Also fix a memory leak in login1_inhibit_cb.
    
    [The intention was to hold one "ref" to the inhibit fd for each
    connection that was waiting to disconnect, plus one "ref" for the
    idle state of "waiting to be notified by logind". We correctly took
    one "ref" per connection, but did not release the extra one. -smcv]

    NEWS: adjust note about ServerAuthentication handlers
    
    rishi pointed out on IRC that ServerAuthentication still makes
    passwords available to eavesdroppers on the session bus (if LOGIN,
    PLAIN or X-TELEPATHY-PASSWORD are used). ServerAuthentication doesn't
    allow arbitrary applications to ask MC "what is the password for
    account X?", which is what I was thinking of.
    
    The session bus is not generally modelled to be a security
    boundary; if yours is, you will need to write a security policy,
    then ensure that that policy is applied. Telepathy components are not
    designed to be used unmodified on an untrusted session bus. (Starting
    points include turning off eavesdropping, applying a "default-deny"
    policy, preventing processes other than Mission Control from
    calling HandleChannels on your ServerAuthentication client, and
    preventing processes from subverting each other with ptrace.)

    avatar-refresh test: subsume avatar-persist, and test more situations
    
    We have some sort of combinatorial explosion going on here, and it
    seems best to test it in a somewhat systematic way:
    
    * is the protocol one where avatars persist on the server (Gabble)
      or not (Salut)?
    * if it's like Gabble, does it download our own avatar token
      before signalling CONNECTED (as I suspect Haze does), or
      on-demand after GetKnownAvatarTokens (as Gabble appears to)?
    * if it's like Gabble, is the server storing an avatar for us?
    * in either case, do we have an avatar stored locally, and has
      it previously been uploaded or not?
    
    In addition, the avatar-refresh and avatar-persist tests exercised
    migration from ~/.missioncontrol and a low-priority XDG_DATA_DIRS entry
    (respectively) to ~/.local/share. I didn't do that in a loop, because
    it isn't applicable in all cases and would lead to even more
    combinations - testing each case once should be enough.

    McdAccount: go back to using GetKnownAvatarTokens
    
    Sadly, contact attributes aren't enough to distinguish between
    "this protocol doesn't store avatars and you haven't re-sent your
    avatar since you last connected", "this protocol stores avatars but
    the CM hasn't checked for your current avatar yet", and "this protocol
    stores avatars, but there is no avatar on the server for you".
    
    GetKnownAvatarTokens specifically excludes the middle option (blocking
    on a server round-trip if it needs to), and uses "avatar token missing"
    for the first and "avatar token empty" for the last.
    
    Tested to work with the telepathy-glib 0.20 branch, and with the 0.22
    branch when fdo#70010 is fixed.

    Also simplify the last of those cases, and avoid a potential symlink

    is a directory controlled by us. In practice we already required that,
    because with-session-bus.sh creates files in the current directory.

    McdConnection: build up our sets of emergency numbers over time
    
    To facilitate this, use nicer data structures.
    
    Most importantly, this means we don't critical whenever we get more
    than one distinct service point, as Jonny noticed while porting to
    Telepathy 1.0. It might slightly defeat the intention of the
    ServicePointsChanged signal, but in practice the list is probably
    never going to shrink, and if it does, it's probably wise to
    keep considering its old members to be an emergency number (the effect
    that that has is that plugins aren't allowed to influence channel
    requests).
    
    Also, don't leak the sets of emergency numbers when finalized.

    Remove the concept of binding accounts to transports
    
    We only have one transport now, so there are two options: either the
    account is a special one that "needs dispatch" and also bypasses the
    transport check (in practice this means cellular accounts), or it is
    connected via the Internet.
    
    Binding accounts to transports never made a vast amount of sense. If we
    have many parallel Internet connections (e.g. wired + wifi + cellular +
    VPN), Mission Control can't know which one a Connection is relying on -
    only the connection manager can know that - so we have to err on the
    side of disconnecting everything on a connectivity change anyway.
    
    A possible refinement in future Tp versions would be a way for a CM
    to tell MC "this connection does its own connectivity-monitoring,
    so don't kick it when we get disconnected". For now, we assume that
    everything needs the Internet, unless it's one of the accounts that
    wouldn't previously have been bound to a connection (i.e.
    _mcd_account_needs_dispatch() returns FALSE).

    Replace ConnMan connectivity support with GNetworkMonitor
    
    The information we're getting from ConnMan is no more informative
    than GNetworkMonitor, and a ConnMan GNetworkMonitor implementation
    exists (e.g. <https://github.com/jukkar/connman-network-monitor>),
    so we might as well go via that.
    
    On NetworkManager systems, we now use NetworkManager to detect
    transient states like DISCONNECTING, but use the GNetworkMonitor
    to detect whether the interface is up. If NetworkManager is the only
    thing managing an interface, that makes no difference, but if there is
    an interface not managed by NetworkManager, the default netlink
    GNetworkMonitor will say we're online even while NM is DISCONNECTED,
    which is what we want.
    
    On non-NetworkManager, non-ConnMan systems where netlink works,
    netlink will tell us at least the basics of what's going on, and we
    can avoid trying to connect while there is no Internet route.
    
    On systems without a working GNetworkMonitor, GIO's default
    implementation will say "yes, you are online" at all times, which is
    no worse than we had previously.

    Split connectivity state into the concepts of "up" and "stable"
    
    ConnMan and GNetworkMonitor only give us two states: either we have
    some level of Internet connectivity, or we don't. NetworkManager adds
    a third category of states (CONNECTING, DISCONNECTING, ASLEEP):
    "you might have connectivity, but things are changing, so you might
    want to disconnect now". I've represented this as "not stable".
    
    The flag is deliberately "stable", not "unstable", so that all the
    boolean flags have the same sense: if they are TRUE, we're
    "more connected".

    McdSlacker: Use org.gnome.SessionManager DBus service
    
    MCE is a long dead Nokia closed source service for Maemo.
    This rewrites McdSlacker using GDBus and the much more useful
    GNOME SessionManager service. That interface is implemented in
    both gnome-shell and unity desktops.

    Only ignore passwords in gnome-keyring if Empathy has copied them
    
    When passwords are stored in the Parameters by MC and no
    SASLAuthentication handler is used, e.g. under Sugar, we currently
    save passwords into gnome-keyring, if enabled at compile time; so, we
    want to read them back out of gnome-keyring.
    
    This conflicts slightly with wanting to ignore passwords in gnome-keyring
    that are left over from an Empathy 3.0 schema migration that failed
    due to fd.o #42088. To avoid failure to authenticate/re-prompt if the
    password has been changed on the service side, ignore passwords that
    are going to be deleted; but to avoid breaking Sugar, don't ignore
    any other passwords we might find in gnome-keyring.

    tests: avoid an out-of-range int literal
    
    In this particular test case, the expected result according to the flags
    is "it fails", so the second column (expected converted value) is not
    relevant.
    
    This apparently causes build warnings (fatal by default) on ILP32
    platforms, because 2147483648 is out-of-range for a signed int or
    signed long on such platforms. It's certainly also out-of-range for
    the struct member it's initializing, which is a gint32.

    McdAccount: store automatic presence as a single attribute
    
    This will be necessary to make its change-notification work correctly.
    
    Use tests/twisted/account-manager/auto-connect.py to exercise the
    automatic migration.
    
    account-storage/default-keyring-storage.py is broken by this change,
    because it asserts that keyfiles from a lower-priority XDG location
    are not automatically migrated to a higher-priority location until
    something actually changes, and the migration of AutomaticPresenceType
    is a change. To avoid that, put the automatic presence in lower-priority
    keyfiles in that test in the new format already.

    McdAccount: add a way to tell property setters that storage has already been updated
    
    This lets us get AccountPropertyChanged signals for more attributes
    changed via McpAccountStorage::altered-one, which would previously be
    suppressed because altered-one's API is that the storage plugin has
    already updated the McdStorage before emitting the signal. The
    property setter would then notice that the value was the same as
    in McdStorage, and assume that that meant it hadn't actually changed.

    mcd_storage_dup_value: don't return non-NULL with error set
    
    The practical effect of this is:
    
    * addressing_set_uri_scheme_association() needs modification to cope
      with a NULL return, which previously never happened (an empty
      string-list was returned on error)
    
    * addressing_get_uri_schemes() needs the same change
    
    * mcd_account_get_parameter() treats parameters whose value in the
      keyfile cannot be interpreted as the desired type as if they were
      unset; previously, it treated them as 0, False, "", [], etc.
    
    The old behaviour of mcd_account_get_parameter() seems undesirable:
    we shouldn't just make up parameter values. If the parameter is boolean
    "require-tls" and its value gets set to 2 for some reason, we should
    invalidate the account, rather than setting it to False and carrying on!

    McdAccount: migrate avatars to a XDG path
    
    This is the easy part of XDGification: there is no plugin involvement or
    anything for avatars (yet!), it's just hard-coded.
    
    Changing the avatar location from a single directory to a search path
    results in some new corner cases, so test them.

    servicetest: don't eavesdrop on method replies or errors
    
    Eavesdropping on method replies breaks libdbus if you call methods using the
    same connection. You can get into a situation like this:
    
    * Test calls a method on MC; say the serial number is 42
    * At around the same time, MC calls a method on gnome-keyring and also uses
      serial number 42
    * gnome-keyring replies, labelled "in reply to 42"
    * Test is eavesdropping, so it sees the reply going from gnome-keyring to MC
    * Test interprets the reply from gnome-keyring to MC as the reply it was
      expecting from MC, sees completely the wrong types, and becomes
      confused
    
    This seems unlikely - but because serial numbers are sequential and
    start from 1 for each connection (as opposed to starting from a random
    offset), two connections can quite easily happen to sync up. I saw it
    happen most recently in the gnome-keyring test. With the benefit
    of hindsight, I think I've seen this before: whenever the tests
    made an Introspect() call which returned a type other than 's', that
    was probably this bug.
    
    We never actually generated events for messages other than signals and
    method calls, so match those ones specifically, and don't eavesdrop on
    replies.

    Migrate from Butterfly to Haze even if Butterfly is no longer installed
    
    Mission Control has a bug/design flaw/whatever in which it doesn't
    know the types of parameters without looking at the corresponding
    connection manager, which doesn't work if that connection manager has
    been uninstalled. This turns out to be bad for the upgrade from
    Debian 6 to Debian 7, which upgrades MC to a version that will
    perform the migration from Butterfly to Haze, but also uninstalls
    Butterfly...
    
    Since we know what the type of 'account' is, with a bit of refactoring
    we can tell McdAccount that we know it's a string, get its value
    anyway, and get on with our lives.

    _keyring_commit: perform deletions for keys in removed, not in secrets
    
    'removed' is essentially a set of (account, key) tuples that should
    be deleted. What we were doing was:
    
        foreach account in removed
            foreach key in secrets[account]
                delete (account, key)
    
    which makes little sense - if we have param-password and
    param-proxy-password and we want to unset Parameters['password'],
    the current implementation would delete both. This commit changes it to:
    
        foreach account in removed
            foreach key in removed[account]
                delete (account, key)
    
    which has the advantage of actually making sense.

    Default account backend: when deleting, always delete from both places
    
    Our tracking of whether something is "secret" (in the gnome-keyring) is
    pretty shaky, and in particular, we can forget that things are meant
    to be "secret" sometimes (we lose that information when deleting
    parameters).
    
    Happily, when we're deleting things, it doesn't actually matter: the
    right thing to do is clearly to delete from both locations, regardless
    of where we think it ought to be.
    
    Similarly, when we're setting a property to a new value, it's appropriate
    to delete it from both locations, then put it in the right location
    (only).

    _keyring_commit: perform deletions for keys in removed, not in secrets
    
    'removed' is essentially a set of (account, key) tuples that should
    be deleted. What we were doing was:
    
        foreach account in removed
            foreach key in secrets[account]
                delete (account, key)
    
    which makes little sense - if we have param-password and
    param-proxy-password and we want to unset Parameters['password'],
    the current implementation would delete both. This commit changes it to:
    
        foreach account in removed
            foreach key in removed[account]
                delete (account, key)
    
    which has the advantage of actually making sense.

    Default account backend: when deleting, always delete from both places
    
    Our tracking of whether something is "secret" (in the gnome-keyring) is
    pretty shaky, and in particular, we can forget that things are meant
    to be "secret" sometimes (we lose that information when deleting
    parameters).
    
    Happily, when we're deleting things, it doesn't actually matter: the
    right thing to do is clearly to delete from both locations, regardless
    of where we think it ought to be.
    
    Similarly, when we're setting a property to a new value, it's appropriate
    to delete it from both locations, then put it in the right location
    (only).

    I'm not sure why this was in McdStorage at all. It's a bit of a layering

    AccountManager. We can fix the layering violation by adding a signal

    Avoid race between Mission Control's two names by having one wait for the other
    
    If you do:
    
    dbus-send --dest=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.MissionControl5 \
      --type=method_call --print-reply / org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer.Ping & \
    dbus-send --dest=org.freedesktop.Telepathy.AccountManager \
    --type=method_call --print-reply / org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer.Ping
    
    then one or both of the calls will fail because the executable claims
    one of its bus names, but can't get the other, and exits 1.
    
    By making one wait for the other, we get the desired behaviour.
    I've made activating MissionControl5 wait for AccountManager because
    in MC's current implementation AccountManager is taken last.

    dispatch test: make sure Ensure-ing channels after delegation/presenting works

commit 54f4fd22c09a342bb58da978b5a055e45f968897
Author: Jonny Lamb <jonny.lamb@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   2012-07-06 16:50:08 +0100

    dispatcher: set channel state back to DISPATCHED after delegating & presenting
    
    _mcd_client_proxy_handle_channels sets the McdChannel state to
    HANDLER_INVOKED, but when we were calling this in both delegate and
    present operations, the state was not being set back to the DISPATCHED
    state afterwards.
    
    The state being wrong meant that dispatching a channel after if had
    been delegated or presented would not happen, as MC thought we were
    still waiting for a handler response.

    we should write a generic refcounted string pool instead (but I doubt

    McdDispatcher: don't be a McdMission
    
    The dispatcher subscribes to the master's abort signal rather than

    McdMission is actually doing anything for it.
    
    This means we can get rid of McdProxy, so, do.

    Remove unused support for a magical auto-away flag set by embedders
    
    Less code, fewer bugs. Also, people should have stopped embedding MC by
    now, and an earlier patch in this series made it impossible.

    Account: don't crash on Get('Parameters') if _dup_parameters fails
    
    If the connection manager is not installed, or is installed but doesn't
    have the protocol for the account, then _mcd_account_dup_parameters()
    returns %NULL. (As the comment I've added says, I think this is
    ridiculous—it's fall-out from MC not storing the types of parameters.)
    
    As a result, Get('Parameters') or GetAll() would crash, because
    dbus-glib would try to serialize a NULL GHashTable and blow up. (See
    <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44939>.) So with this
    patch, we handle NULL as "no parameters" for the sake of D-Bus
    properties. (Because this situation should only arise if the account is
    invalid, we also warn if _dup_parameters() returns NULL for valid
    accounts.)

    Produce DLL files when compiled for windows When we cross-compile telepathy-mission-control for windows with the current flags we end up with a static library and it creates link issues in libraries and applications which uses teleapthy-glib on windows. to solve this -no-undefined LDFLAG is introduced in this commit. This ensures all the symbols are defined when we compile for windows.

    Use _unref instead of _free _destroy when possible.unref
    
    Replace g_(ptr_)array_free (foo, TRUE) and g_hash_table_destroy
    with respectively g_(ptr_)array_unref (foo) and g_hash_table_unref.
    
    I used this command to generate this patch:
    for f in `find -name "*.c"`; do sed -i $f -re 's/g_ptr_array_free \(([^ ,]+), TRUE\)/g_ptr_array_unref \(\1\)/'; done

    Remove stray <enum/> from GSettings schema
    
    I forgot to remove this when duplicating the one key I wanted to steal
    from Empathy, and ioni reported that it clashes with the same enum
    definition provided by Empathy. (I'm not 100% sure why—I'd've assumed
    they'd be namespaced by the GSettings schema, not the DConf path—but

    Bind use-conn GSettings key to ConnectivityMonitor
    
    This GSettings key does the same thing as the Empathy one it's an alias
    for does: if use-conn is False, the network state from NM/ConnMan is
    ignored, and MC will allow you to try to sign in even if there is
    supposedly no network connection! It's pretty great.
    
    (When I first committed this, it didn't work. Now it does. I don't know
    why.)

    Add a GSettings schema with use-conn key
    
    When the NM/ConnMan code lived in Empathy, there was a GSettings key
    which could be flipped to false to make Empathy always assume it had a
    network connection.
    
    This schema provides one GSettings key,
    im.telepathy.MissionControl.FromEmpathy use-conn, which happens to use
    the same dconf path as the Empathy key uses. This should make the two
    GSettings keys aliases for the same underlying value in dconf; we get a
    migration path for free.

    update-parameters.py: fix the cache directory
    
    Use $XDG_CACHE_HOME instead of $MC_ACCOUNT_DIR to find the file
    mcp-test-diverted-account-plugin.conf because the test-only plugin
    mcp-account-diversion uses g_get_user_cache_dir().
    
    This is a no-op because both variables have the same value, as defined in
    tests/twisted/Makefile.am:
    
    BASIC_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT = \

    However, this was not semantically correct, and the two directories could be
    different in the future, with installed tests for example.

    Account: only set ChangingPresence if we actually are
    
    Previously, ChangingPresence could become True on accounts which were
    not Enabled, which makes no sense: we're not changing our presence in
    that case. It happened if you requested an offline presence on a
    disabled account whose current RequestedPresence is something online; or
    if you disabled an Enabled account whose RequestedPresence (and
    CurrentPresence) was offline.
    
    Here we change the implementation of setting RequestedPresence to only
    set ChangingPresence to True if it actually takes some action. There are
    situations where the presence has "changed" (maybe you changed the
    message associated with being offline) but no change actually needs to
    be applied.

    McdClient: don't allow unique_name to become NULL
    
    _mcd_client_registry_found_name() is called in three situations:
    
    • the initial call to ListNames() has returned;
    • the initial call to ListActivatableNames() has returned; and
    • NameOwnerChanged has been emitted for a client-shaped well-known name.
    
    In the first two cases, unique_name_if_known is NULL; in the first case,
    activatable is FALSE.
    
    I don't really understand what business the McdClientRegistry has
    telling the McdClient what its unique name is even when it's non-NULL,
    but passing NULL to _mcd_client_proxy_set_active() made McdClient
    violate an internal invariant. The first action McdClient takes is to
    discover the client's unique name, if any; if the client is not running,
    unique_name is set to "" (not NULL). Other parts of the McdClient
    internals assume (and assert) that unique_name is not NULL by the time
    they run.
    
    I *believe* that the client registry need not ever call
    _mcd_client_proxy_set_active(), but I am loathe to make that change
    without fully understanding the code and writing some tests.

    Master: Always bind connection to a transport
    
    Previously, when a connection was brought online in response to
    an event other than a transport becoming connected, it would always be
    bound to a transport (if any transport plugins are loaded, obviously),
    regardless of whether the dictionary o' conditions was empty or not.
    However, when a transport coming online caused a connection to be
    brought up, that connection would not be bound to the transport that
    caused it to come online if the conditions were empty (which they
    generally are).
    
    For reasons I can't quite fathom, this actually doesn't seem to have
    affected anything: it could be because monitor_state_changed_cb in
    McdKludgeTransport also binds waiting connections to the transport that
    came online. But this seems like a sensible change for sanity and
    consistency reasons.

    Account: reconnect if RequestedPresence is not offline
    
    Previously, when a network connection came back up, only accounts with

    Previously, if an account was taken offline due to the internet

    doing something else'), I don't see why a network connection blip should
    cause my lovingly-written presence to be discarded.

    opposed to just that the account be brought online.

    mctest: split up enable_fakecm_account()
    
    This patch splits out the second half of enable_fakecm_account(),
    starting at the point where it expects a RequestConnection call, into a
    new function, expect_fakecm_connection(). enable_fakecm_account() calls
    it, so its behaviour does not change. But the connectivity-monitoring
    tests will want to expect a call to RequestConnection() and let that
    part of the standard check run to completion, so will be able to use the
    freshly-split-out function.

    mctest: resuscitate MC asynchronously
    
    Shortly, MC will start making blocking calls on the test suite's fake NM
    implementation (via nm-glib).
    
    Calling bus.get_object service-activated MC as a side-effect of making a
    blocking call to Introspect() on it, so it deadlocked. I think it's
    clearer to explicitly, asynchronously activate it, and wait for it to
    claim its names; which also avoids the deadlock.

    account-manager/create-with-properties: modernize and asyncify
    
    For some reason, the blocking call to Introspect here reliably
    deadlocked against the blocking call MC will, in a couple of patches'
    time, make to (the fake) Network Manager service implemented by the test
    suite. Removing it just made the GetAll() call deadlock instead. If I
    render that asynchronous, the deadlock goes away.
    
    I am not overly happy with having to do this kind of ad-hoc kludging of
    the test suite to make it run, but we're working around a library bug
    and I have no interest in delaying the NM integration while I fix
    nm-glib.

    Master: poison singleton pointer when disposed
    
    Previously, when the 'default' instance of McdMaster (i.e., the
    singleton) was disposed, the 'default_master' variable was left pointing
    to it. This is basically fine in practice, since the McdMaster is meant
    to survive for the lifetime of the connection. But I hit a weird crash
    (caused by the test suite's version of MC waiting 5 seconds after the
    McdMaster is destroyed before closing, which interacts badly with the
    reconnection timeout being less than 5 seconds) and it would have been
    much clearer what was happening if 'default_master' had held a known-bad
    address rather than a possibly-valid pointer to a freed object.
    
    This doesn't change the behaviour of the code in any significant way:
    we'll still crash in this situation. But as far as I can tell the bug is
    harmless.

    with-session-bus.sh: retain newline when forking dbus-monitor

    Tests: remove stale FIXMEs about closing channels
    
    Since 5dfe2f0, Mission Control has not called Close() on channels when
    you disconnect. The test for this incorrect behaviour was commented out
    at some point, with a FIXME that the behaviour should be changed.
    
    Well, now the behaviour has been changed. So I replaced one with an
    assertion that Close() is not called, and the other I just removed
    (since that test doesn't actually have any channels).

    It doesn't make sense to not use the boolean type provided by our framework
    and using 1 bit variable introduces weird corner case when being casted with
    gboolean.

    Stop building docs for libmissioncontrol-server
    
    I'm hitting a weird issue in gtk-doc where the handwritten .types file
    is overwritten with a generated one during distcheck (but not during
    normal out-of-tree builds). Given that we have a newer plugin API we're
    keener on, let's just stop building documentation for the old one. (Most
    distros do not distribute libmissioncontrol-server as a library anyway.)
    
    The mission-control-plugins documentation doesn't hit this issue because
    it doesn't have a handwritten .types file. Instead, it relies on gtk-doc
    generating it, and uses IGNORE_HFILES to filter out internal headers.
    This seems more maintainable, so if anyone wants to resurrect this old
    documentation, I'd do it that way.

    Arguably, we should have some way that approvers can opt-in to being told
    about undispatchable channels that they might want to Claim, but that
    requires spec, whereas we can fix this straight away.

    We don't do this when calling _mcd_request_handle_internally (., ., FALSE)

    gtk-doc 1.17 runs in the builddir, not the sourcedir. So these files end
    up in the builddir, which is where we're running.
    
    Unfortunately this breaks doc checks with gtk-doc ≤ 1.16, which I can't
    find the strength to care about.
    
    (This is akin to 3ab0d76 in tp-glib.)

    Include CM name when protocol doesn't exist
    
    This is not really ideal—the real error is that the CM doesn't exist but
    due to the current design of this part of MC, it's actually not easy to
    determine that.
    
    So at least including the name of the CM might make the error more
    obvious.

    AccountManager: use _mcd_account_set_parameters error verbatim

    Account: use NotImplemented for nonexistant cm/protocols
    
    The spec is actually pretty clear on this point.

    mcd_account_check_validity: report a GError for invalid accounts
    
    This corrects the specific case of poor error reporting mentioned on
    <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40337>, where MC
    previously said “The supplied CM parameters were not valid” but now
    actually says which one.
    
    There are a couple of other account-creation cases (namely “CM doesn't
    exist” and “CM doesn't have that protocol”) which don't give the correct
    errors. And the test doesn't test the “Protocol doesn't have one of the
    specified parameters” case.

    McdAccount: use mcd_account_is_valid internally too
    
    This will make it simpler to change how validity is represented (from a
    boolean to a GError).

    mc-tool: make bool parsing sane.
    
    Previously, mc-tool update acct bool:foo=true would set foo to False!
    Particularly ridiculous given that mc-tool show produces 'true' and
    'false', not '1' and '0'.
    
    I'm *sure* I've fixed this before.

    make Handler suitability-checking asynchronous
    
    In the general case, when we do the check the Handler won't be running
    yet, so we can't check its group ID, Aegis credentials or any other
    process parameters; so plugins may need to be able to activate it and
    wait for it to start, and MC should be able to do other work in the
    meantime.

    Use GetConnectionCredentials() when checking credentials synchronously
    
    This avoids a time of check / time of use vulnerability.
    
    Also, don't crash if the D-Bus call fails.

    McpDispatchOperationPolicyIface: make the GInterface into public API
    
    We can stay compatible as long as we don't change or reorder methods:
    adding methods to the end of a GInterface is considered to be a
    compatible change.

    Now that we're using McpDispatchOperation, this function isn't needed.

    mcp_dbus_channel_acl_authorised: redo API in terms of McpDispatchOperation
    
    This vastly simplifies both the caller (McdDispatchOperation) and the
    plugin.

Author: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   2011-05-05 16:48:01 +0100

    Move channel ACL traversal to McdDispatchOperation
    
    This is a helper for MC itself and isn't needed by plugins, so it
    shouldn't be in the mission-control-plugins library.

Author: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   2011-05-05 16:46:25 +0100

    Flatten AegisChannelAcl into AegisAcl, which now implements both interfaces
    
    This means we don't need any extra glue to hook it into MC as a
    pseudo-plugin.

    The handler is already handling the channels here, so this can only be a
    problem if you already got it wrong; there's no transfer of responsibility.

    Allow requests to be blocked/unblocked on a per-account basis
    
    This allows internally generated requests which require external
    interaction to be atomic from the point of view of the caller,
    and prevents MC and "real" handlers from treadin on one-another's
    toes.

commit a53807c9d8dc3b0d4e745a5e01be2ed64bd65adb
Author: Vivek Dasmohapatra <vivek@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   2011-03-21 18:02:32 +0000

    Allow MC to set callbacks for internally generated requests
    
    These requests will typically be handled by MC itself rather than being
    dispatched to a "real" handler.

    Be more robust against cataclysmic test failures
    
    Previously, if MC never claimed its bus names (because it was crashing
    on startup, for instance), the exception in the test initialization code
    wasn't caught. This means nothing would ever quit the Twisted mainloop,
    and the (failed) test would sit there forever.
    
    This patch ensures that the test exits uncleanly if this happens.

    Preserve deleted account while calling Identify
    
    When an account is deleted, we'd expect that the McdAccount object will
    die shortly afterwards. However, we need to ensure that RemoveAccount is
    called on connection managers that implement AccountStorage. Previously,
    the account object was used as the weak_object for the callback to
    IdentifyAccount; this could mean that the callback would never fire, and
    thus we'd never get around to calling RemoveAccount.
    
    So this patch holds a reference for that callback.

    Make it possible to optionally implement interfaces on a MC object
    
    Defining an interface as MCD_IMPLEMENT_OPTIONAL_IFACE() indicates it should
    not be included in an object's Interface property by default. Instead the
    interface is activated by calling mcd_dbus_activate_optional_interface() on
    an individual object instance.
    
    This makes it possible to implement interfaces such as
    Acct.I.ExternalPasswordStorage only on accounts whose Connection Manager
    supports it.

    UpdateParameters(): allow unsetting nonexistant parameters
    
    I missed the spec's decree that literally anything be permitted in the
    list of parameters to unset, and since there was no test for this nuance
    I made it regress. Here's a fix and a test.

    She's right, it's not clear. Nicolas suggested this even clearer
    implementation. (It would be even even clearer and shorter if this
    function returned a value rather than calling a callback
    (synchronously), but oh well.)

    UpdateParameters: break apart check_parameter_update()
    
    I had thought that the logic for setting and clearing parameters was
    similar enough that combining them would be a net win, but it seems that
    that was not the case. This patch rearranges check_one_parameter()
    check_parameter_update() into check_one_parameter_update() for parameter
    updates, and check_one_parameter_unset() for unset parameters. There is
    a little duplication, but these are much easier to follow.
    
    Dear reviewer, I'm sorry for the many false starts in this branch. I
    did try to rebase them out of existence, but…

    UpdateParameters: check for setting parameters to their default
    
    A few patches ago, we made MC smarter about unsetting parameters which
    have default values. Here, we make the symmetrical case work: explicitly
    setting a previously-unset parameter to its default value should not
    need a reconnect to take effect.
    
    I really don't like how complicated check_parameter_update() has become,
    but this does actually seem to need to be this complicated to get every
    case right. Perhaps check_one_parameter() should be split into 'set' and
    'unset' cases.

    UpdateParameters: apply Unset parameters immediately, if possible.
    
    If a parameter in the Unset list was previously set to its default
    value, there's no need to reconnect to apply the change. Also, if its
    default value is different, but it's got the DBus_Property flag, we can
    apply it to the running connection.
    
    Distressingly, fixing this does not actually make this code much
    simpler.

    Currently this doesn't hide accounts; it just looks for accounts of a
    different service type. But hey, this is a start.

    accounts-glib: make service type parametrizable
    
    Rather than hard-coding the "IM" string everywhere, we now call a
    private method which looks up the accounts-glib service type from a
    field in the class structure. The default implementation is of course
    "IM", but this will allow a subclass which looks for a different type of
    accounts.

    accounts-glib: List services in constructed, not init
    
    I'm about to replace the hard-coded AG_SERVICE constant with a field in
    the class (so that a subclass can look for other services and set Hidden
    to True for those accounts). However, as we discovered way back in
    f7b7aa8e477abe03c1340c2b200ddcf9c9792c2c, when _init runs for class T,
    G_OBJECT_TYPE() always returns T even if we're constructing a subclass.
    So we're going to need to wait until constructed() to get at the desired
    service name.

    Storage: allow backends to implement only one of commit/commit_one
    
    This mostly reverts 0d914e13cc4a6e84cebb840c0be4d32abaacaddc, except
    that it preserves the fix for the bug which could cause a NULL ->commit
    implementation to be called. I do not believe this interdependency is
    “irrational”: it reduces the boilerplate that backend implementations
    need. Plus, this makes the implementation match the documentation again.
    
    This also improves the debugging messages logged by
    mcp_account_storage_commit() and mcp_account_storage_commit_all().

    Account: ensure updated string properties are committed.
    
    Properties whose setters were implemented using
    mcd_account_set_string_val() were actually not committed to disk
    unless/until some later property whose implementation is correct was
    updated.
    
    I noticed this in passing, not while checking out any particular bug.
    However, I think it may be responsible for the issue where people's
    aliases are re-set to their JID for no apparent reason. I don't really
    have any evidence to back this up. I did tweak one of the storage tests
    to expose this bug, though.
    
    I've checked a whole bunch of other properties, and I think the ones not
    implemented using mcd_account_set_string_val() were all already okay.

    mcd-dispatch-operation: explicitly cancel calling approvers instead of accidentally
    
    Previously, the "run approvers in an idle" function would be called
    when an observer returned even if he or she called
    HandleWith{,Time}. The idle function would set
    invoked_approvers_if_needed to TRUE and try and run the approvers if
    needed, followed by checking the client locks again. This made
    non-interactive approvers implemented as delaying observers work
    because it wouldn't actually call ADO on approvers due to
    mcd_dispatch_operation_is_approved returning TRUE, but this way makes
    the process a little more clear to understand.

    create-with-properties: remove unsound signal expectation
    
    When this test creates a new account, it expects four events to occur:
    
    • A.AccountPropertyChanged, to say the new account is valid;
    • AM.AccountValidityChanged, to say the new account is valid;
    • CreateAccount returning successfully;
    • RequestConnection on the fake CM, because ConnectAutomatically was
      set to True and RequestedPresence was set to non-offline in
      CreateAccount.
    
    However, if the account's not yet been announced by
    AccountValidityChanged, MC has no reason to emit AccountPropertyChanged
    on it. It happens that, in some cases, it does; but this depends on
    whether or not MC has already introspected the fake CM by the time the
    account is created. So the test is wrong to expect
    AccountPropertyChanged. Instead, we check that Account.Valid is in sync
    with what AccountValidityChanged said.
    
    This fixes an issue where this test would only pass if it was run after
    account-manager/create-twice, but not if it was run individually.

    create-at-startup: don't expect ObserveChannels calls so close together
    
    Now that preparing the connection takes one more step, it can take
    longer before ObserveChannels is called with the channel that just
    appeared on connecting, so let's allow that to appear earlier.
    
    This only relaxes the test assumptions a little. Although it currently
    fails on 0.13.9 and this fixes it, it'll still work on tp-glib <
    0.13.9.

    Remove MinimumPresence implementation.
    
    I feel kind of bad doing this, but it turned out not to be needed. I
    think it's better to take dead code out, rather than leaving it kicking
    around to potentially complicate matters later.

    McdDBusProp: remove get_async
    
    The only property that was implemented in an async fashion was
    Account.Parameters. Since that's now synchronous, we can bin this code
    for getting properties asynchronously.

    Make _mcd_account_dup_parameters() synchronous
    
    This is a really massive patch, and I'm very sorry.
    
    Previously _mcd_account_dup_parameters() took a callback parameter. This
    was because mcd_account_get_parameter() took a callback parameter. The
    latter used to actually be asychronous in the gnome-keyring case, but it
    is not any more, thanks to the harmonious account backend API.
    
    So we can remove a *lot* of unnecessary complexity if we make the latter
    return the parameter's value synchronously, and hence make the former
    return a GHashTable synchronously. In particular, this means we can make
    retrieving the Parameters D-Bus property synchronous, which means we can
    port to TpDBusPropertiesMixin.
    
    I did try to split this patch up, but as you, dear reader, will be able
    to see from what I ended up with, this code was all really entangled
    with itself. This is the best I could do.

    McdAccount: Remove un-overridden virtual methods
    
    No known subclass of McdAccount overrides get_parameter, set_parameter,
    delete or load these days. People should be, and are, using the new
    pluggable storage backends API. So it's safe to remove these methods
    from the vtable. This will simplify refactoring their (default)
    implementations.

    Account.Service: remove unnecessary explicit fallback.
    
    dbus-glib treats a GValue containing a NULL string as equivalent to a
    GValue containing "", at least in this context. Many other properties
    rely on this behaviour; so let's just rely on it here too.

    Tests: correct name of Conditions.Condition property
    
    The property's actually called Condition, not Conditions. But because
    McdDBusProp returns the same error for “unknown property” and “wrong
    type”, the test passed.

    It seems we changed the implementation but not the header, and Solaris CC
    is stricter about this than gcc. Since the header defines our API, it
    seems better to fix this in the implementation for the moment.

    Set CurrentPresence to Unset if online without SimplePresence
    
    The spec says:
    
        If the connection is online but does not support the SimplePresence
        interface, this should be (Connection_Presence_Type_Unset, "", "").
    
    But previously we only updated CurrentPresence in response to
    PresencesChanged being emitted for our self handle, which it obviously
    never is by connections which don't implement SimplePresence.
    
    (Actually, this was right by accident until my previous commit, because
    CurrentPresence was initialized to (0, NULL, NULL).)

    I'm unable to test it and it looks unfinished.

commit c68547b12b3371eb1c67e2640e7d0f270f5890ef

    Run account storage tests in their own session, and not in installcheck
    
    The gnome-keyring test assumes that it's talking to a MC instance
    configured to use the temporary keyring, which won't be true unless we
    run it in its own instance; the diverted-storage test makes assumptions
    about account naming that aren't necessarily true in a non-new MC
    instance.
    
    Similarly, these tests use Abort() which isn't in the real MC.

    The McdStorage layer uses get/set _value, the actual plugins need to use _string
    
    This way the layer closest to actual storage in a real actually-on-disc
    keyfile make sure escaping is handled, while all layers above them can
    simply treat the values as "data" without caring how or where they
    are stored.

    New McdStorage interface for storing/retrieving account settings + params
    
    The McpAccountStorage interface used to communicate with the storage plugins
    
    The McdStorage interface is what MC in general should use to store/inspect/
    update/whatever account details, and is responsible for managing the storage
    plugins. It replaces the old method of stealing the account manager's
    internal data structures via the McdAccount and changing them behind
    the account manager's back.

    _mcd_channel_request_proceed: don't allow for absent accounts
    
    In earlier versions, this could possibly have happened if the code was
    tangled enough. However, McdRequest holds a reference to the account,
    so there's no way a McdRequest can not have an account.

    mcd-account-requests: connect to ready-to-request earlier
    
    It can't actually be emitted until Proceed() is called, but if we connect
    to it ahead of time, _mcd_account_proceed_with_request doesn't actually
    need the McdChannel.

Author: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   2010-09-08 13:53:05 +0100

    mcd-account-requests: defer Proceed() until the dispatcher has been told
    
    This matches the order of events in the modern API, and means that the
    implementation of Proceed() can safely assume that the dispatcher knows
    about the channel request.
    
    This does break the expectations of the old-API tests: previously, we
    incorrectly asserted that AddRequest happened after calling CreateChannel
    on the connection manager, but either order would be valid, and in fact
    the new order makes more sense.

    McdDispatcher: work out possible handlers from McdRequest and/or TpChannels
    
    This avoids ambiguities caused by McdChannel being a (request or channel
    or both).
    
    As a bonus, assume_requested can go away, since it's inferred from the
    presence or absence of @request.
    
    This relies on some previously implicit assumptions, which are now
    assertions:
    - the McdChannel in _mcd_dispatcher_reinvoke_handler has both a McdRequest
      and a TpChannel
    - each McdChannel in _mcd_dispatcher_take_channels has a TpChannel

    This resulted in leaking the McdRequest, and hence compensated for the bug

    dispatcher/ensure-rapidly.py: test with all possible event orders
    
    Before tracking down the bug fixed by the previous commit, I thought it
    was caused by subtleties of event ordering; it wasn't, but the extra
    coverage is good to have anyway.

commit af5207af0ab7578765f24fff9f1cbe40f3f22d08
Author: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   2010-09-06 17:18:05 +0100

    Copy the TpChannel to a proxy McdChannel when setting it up
    
    This fixes an assertion failure when emitting SucceededWithChannel for a
    proxy (secondary) representation of a channel (i.e. the second and
    subsequent EnsureChannel requests that returned a particular channel).
    
    To do this without putting a non-primary representation of a channel
    into the dispatching machinery (which breaks tracking which requests
    where satisfied) it's necessary to add _mcd_channel_is_primary_for_path;
    see that function's doc-comment for the definition of "primary" and
    "proxy" in this context.

    The state is a pair of booleans in SSO, but a single flag in MC, so we

    Retrieve the account storage plugin lazily.
    
    Apparently mcd_account_manager_get_storage_plugin can be called too early when
    the account is created, before it is written to the storage plugin.
    
    This patch makes it reference the account storage plugin lazily when needed,
    and to fail when it can't retrieve it.
    
    I tried to have it retrieve the storage plugin consistently at a later stage,
    but there is no way of knowing when the account is written to the storage
    plugin since there are multiple code paths. So this seemed like the safest
    choice.

    Can't use the AvatarRetrieved signal to find out if an avatar has been removed
    
    The signal only fired for those contacts that had an avatar, so if the
    connection signals that the avatar has been updated, and we then try to
    fetch the avatar via this signal, we simply never receive any data and
    the avatar we have never gets erased.

    fd.o #24645: _mcd_dispatcher_reinvoke_handler: try to use the same Handler
    
    If a process has Handler well-known names A and B, and a channel
    that was already passed to A's HandleChannels implementation is returned
    by EnsureChannels, we want to call HandleChannels on A if it still exists,
    or failing that, B if its filter matches the channel.
    
    This is particularly useful if A was a PreferredHandler with an empty
    list of filters, as used by the proposed
    tp_account_create_channel_and_handle_async().

    Attempt to reconnect less frequently.
    
    The previous constants made MC really keen. Trying again after 1 second
    is fine if the CM crashed, but the normal situation is that the server
    fell over, or the network is broken, in which case 10 seconds, 30
    seconds, 1½ minutes, 4½ minutes, 13½ minutes, then every half hour seems
    a lot more reasonable.

    Only flush changed account details to disk.
    
    Previously every time any property of any account changed, every account
    was flushed to storage. This is really, really bad if you use
    gnome-keyring, because it meant a pair of calls to Unlock()/CreateItem()
    for each secret on each account, every time anything changes. On my
    machine, signing in 6 accounts entailed 384 pairs of calls — 64 per
    account! Furthermore,
    it seems that the implementation of CreateItem() calls fsync(), so my
    hard disk would thrash for about thirty seconds.
    
    This patch adds an optional argument to
    mcd_account_manager_write_conf_async() and mcp_account_storage_commit(),
    indicating which account changed. If NULL, everything is flushed; if
    non-NULL, only that account is flushed. In my testing this reduced
    logging in to 9 Unlock()/CreateItem() pairs, which is still more than
    zero, but stops the disk thrashing quite so badly.
    
    Removing accounts doesn't cause the secrets to be removed from the
    keyring... but that's not a new bug. Everything else seems to work as
    expected.
    
    I didn't update the libaccounts-glib backend to benefit from this, but
    given that all it does is iterate across all accounts and call two
    methods on each, it should be easy enough.

    This reenables NormalizedName and AutomaticPresence by requesting those

    Default account storage plugin: guard against g_key_file_get_keys returning NULL
    
    If the group in question doesn't exist in the keyfile (typically because
    an account didn't exist in the GNOME keyring, in the last patch band),
    the @length argument isn't initialized.
    
    We could initialize @length to 0, but that's not very obvious.

    Only Maemo, and MC tools like mc-tool, use this library; the latter can
    safely be statically linked to it, and the former already enables MCD
    plugins.

    Don't cache whether we have the requests interface
    
    One use of the caching (in _mcd_connection_request_channel) was subtly
    incorrect: before using the cached variable we checked whether the
    TpConnection was ready, but that's not the same thing as checking whether
    our on_connection_ready() callback (which caches it) has actually been
    called yet.
    
    This fixes a regression in dispatcher/connect-for-request.py.

    Account verification calls shouldn't happen until after the manager is ready.
    
    This meant that the first account for any given manager might not have been
    announced over dbus depending on a race between the CM becoming ready and
    the account verification callback being invoked (for accounts created by
    storage backends like libaccounts-glib/SSO at any rate).

    set '0' as UserActionTime when HandleWith() is called
    
    '0' means 'no user action' which is the safer choice to prevent focus
    stealing. User should use a futur variant of HandleWith() allowing him to pass
    a UserActionTime when needed.

    SSO accounts can have multiple services, but this is not exposed as a property.
    
    Instead, expose it as a special property which is not covered by the standard
    iterator but will be returned if you ask for it.
    
    Also, exclude the property from being saved, since the list of services can
    change and should not be cached in the SSO storage for the account itself.

    Revisit the SSO account storage plugin now we have some concrete examples
    
    The following points are addressed:
    
    * The hardwired SSO service selection is gone
    * We now very carefully pick an IM service where necessary
    * We un-set the service where necessary to get global settings
    * We are careful to leave the selected service in the same state
      on function exit as it was on entry.

    Incomplete accounts resulted in account manager load locks never being released.
    
    This meant that the account manager's dbus name was never claimed, as it
    sat around forever waiting for the account's manager to become ready,
    (or fail) but this could never happen as the incomplete account didn't
    have a manager at all.

    Don't re-create objects for accounts we already have
    
    It seems that accounts from the accounts-glib loader pop up twice, once
    from the GKeyFile and once from the 'created' signal. Until we figure
    out why it's happening, let's add a cheesy hack that prevents the
    instance from the GKeyFile being created.
    
    Also add extra debugging to add_account() so we can see when accounts
    are added and where they've come from.

    Uncork account stores when master calls _setup()
    
    This ensures that the McdMaster actually exists before we start creating
    accounts all over the place, and prevents a loop where instantiating an
    McdAccountManager instantiates an McdAccount which instantiates an
    McdMaster which instantiates an McdAccountManager...

    AM: initialize D-Bus property interfaces in _init()
    
    It turns out that it is unsafe to do this at any later point, due to a
    series of surprising facts:
    
    • mcd_dbus_init_interfaces_instances (obj) is implemented in terms of
      g_type_get_qdata (G_OBJECT_TYPE (obj), ...).
    
    • osso-mission-control subclasses McdAccountManager.
    
    • This code:
    
        GType s, t; // s is a subtype of t;
    
        g_type_set_qdata (t, FOO, BAR);
    
        gpointer data = g_type_get_qdata (s, FOO);
    
      sets data to NULL because g_type_get_qdata() does not consider
      superclasses.
    
    • Remarkably, calling mcd_dbus_init_interfaces_instances() from the
      _init() function works because the code that runs each instance_init()
      function in the hierarchy in turn sets the object under construction's
      GTypeClass to be the particular type whose init() is running, rather
      than the final type of the object!
    
    This was a fun debugging session.

    Load and use the account storage plugins, with two pseudo-plugins by default.
    
    The pseudo-plugins are the keyfile plugin (an oject that implements the
    relevant plugin interface, even though it isn't loaded as a plugin) and
    the gnome keyring plugin (ditto) which are loaded at advertised priorities.
    
    When no other plugins are loaded, the keyring plugin should transparently
    steal all secret parameters from accounts in the mcd-account-manager,
    provided that the keyring daemon is accessible.

    Implement the gnome keyring and gkeyfile storage plugins
    
    These two plugins will always be loaded at known (and exposed) priorities,
    this allows plugins that want to steal secrets (eg passwords) to slot
    themselves in at a higher priority than the keyring plugin, and those
    that should not receive passwords to slot themselves in between the
    keyring and keyfile plugins.

    The shim interface, and the object implementing it, that get passed to
    account storage plugins to allow them to get/set parameters and to check
    to see whether they are secret (or flag them as secret).

    Update the account storage plugin interface to the new API
    
    The previous implementation was granular at the account level, new API allows
    plugins to grab individual account.key pairs, which means we can relocate
    the gnome-keyring support to the account storage layer instead of having it
    sit above in the mcd-account object.

    McdDispatchOperation: add easy API for various dispatch operation attributes
    
    Plugins will need these.

    mc-server: give NULL to the new default log handler now that tp-glib has been fixed
    
    fd.o#23843 was fixed in telepathy-glib 0.7.37. MC already depends on
    0.7.37, so this is just a matter of replacing the user_data workaround
    smcv added with the correct value of NULL.

    McdAccount: update TpConnection in _mcd_account_set_connection_status
    
    When we receive a new TpConnection, that function is called when it's
    ready, which is more useful than having a connection that isn't ready.

    McdAccount: keep a reference to the TpConnection ourselves

    McdConnection: pass TpConnection to McdAccount in the same signal as the connection status change

    McdAccount: guarantee to emit ConnectionStatus and ConnectionStatusReason in the same signal
    
    Previously, we relied on the 10ms delay hack to get them to be in the
    same signal, but this way seems better.
    
    This requires a small expectation change in
    account-manager/auto-connect.py: previously we were relying on the 10ms
    delay hack delaying the emission of
    { ConnectionStatusChanged => CONNECTING } until after Connect() was
    called, which doesn't really seem right in any case (conceptually, we're
    trying to connect even before we call RequestConnection).
    
    Similarly, avatar-persist and avatar-refresh encode the same faulty
    assumption. Since that code is adequately tested in auto-connect.py,
    and isn't really the point of the avatar tests, I've just removed the
    faulty expectation from them.

    McdAccount: preallocate priv->changed_properties in init
    
    In practice, we'll basically always change a property, so there's no point
    in delaying this.

    McdAccount: remove support for emitting property changes instantly
    
    There's no point in this being configurable.

    mcd_account_changed_property: ref account while waiting for a deferred AccountPropertiesChanged
    
    Otherwise there's a possible use-after-free (someone changes a property
    then deletes the account within 10ms).
